              Jonah was installing a roof for my neighbor and stopped by my
              house when he noticed pieces of my roof that were in my front
              yard. He offered me a free estimate. Jonah was very professional
              and efficient. He texted me a quote the next day (including
              pictures of the damage) and shortly after that sent over a
              contract by email. His quote was reasonable, and he was able to do
              the work within the week, which was awesome due to the nature of
              the roof repair. Jonah showed up on time, worked all day, and
              returned the next day to finish a few details he felt was
              important. I loved that he sent me before and after photos because
              itâ€™s hard to tell with it being a roof. We have already planned to
              have Jonah fix a window and our deck in the spring. Def recommend
              him!!

              Jonah and his team installed a new roof on my mother's ranch house
              in Grosse Pointe. The work was completed timely and with great
              precision. The clean up was completed immediately after the roof
              was installed. Nothing was left behind. The entire team was polite
              and professional. The young men who did the work were very fit and
              seemed well suited to do the work. On top of all of the good
              comments I can make about the work itself, the price was also very
              reasonable. I would highly recommend Pointe Roofing.

              Jonah and his crew were truly professional, attentive, hard
              working and thorough. They installed a whole new gutter system
              around my home in Grosse Pointe, and did a great job. Their prices
              were also very competitive and fair.

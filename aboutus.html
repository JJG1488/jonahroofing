            Jonah-Dane has been working in the home improvement industry since
            he was in high school. Learning most of his skills working with his
            family, Jonah eventually decided to venture off and start a roofing
            business of his own. Jonah is a father of 1, and a friend to many.
            Spending time with his family, playing his guitar, exercising,
            traveling and most importantly his health and wellness are just a
            few things Jonah is big on. Having a passion for the performing
            arts, graduating from an art school, Jonah always had an eye for
            esthetics, style and art.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using his talents, Jonah has built a strong relationship between
            business and his many happy customers including a long lasting name
            for himself that displays what hard work can accomplish. Jonah-Dane
            is just one phone call or text away if you would like to receive an
            estimate and contract from Pointe Roofing Improvements, you can get
            started today. Jonah will be there to help you and will walk you
